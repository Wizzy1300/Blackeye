Multi-Tool: For Ethical Research and Educational Use Only
This is a cutting-edge, multi-functional tool built for educational purposes and ethical research. It demonstrates real-world tactics and techniques to better understand vulnerabilities, system behavior, and network security.

Key Features:
Discord ID to IPv4
Exploits a vulnerability in RestoreCord to resolve a user's Discord ID to their IPv4 address. Useful for understanding how platform security can be compromised through misconfigurations.

Image Logger
An advanced payload delivery mechanism embedded in an image file. When opened, it executes commands to simulate infection scenarios—ideal for studying attack vectors and defense mechanisms.

Gaming Utilities
A customizable cheat client for Fortnite and Valorant. Built to analyze and test anti-cheat systems and understand the security frameworks of modern games.

DDoS Simulation Tool
Launches stress-testing attacks using our C2 servers, allowing you to evaluate server resilience under extreme conditions. Note: This should only be used on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This tool is intended only for ethical purposes in controlled environments where explicit authorization has been provided. Misuse, including illegal activities such as unauthorized DDoS attacks or data exploitation, is a violation of the law.
